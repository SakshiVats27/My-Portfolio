# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

Vite supports React through two official plugins:

@vitejs/plugin-react: This plugin uses Babel for Fast Refresh and includes support for React Fast Refresh, which allows for hot reloading of React components during development.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc: This plugin uses SWC for Fast Refresh, offering a faster alternative to Babel for compiling and transforming React code.

Both plugins aim to improve the development experience with Vite by providing fast and efficient Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for React applications.

Key Points:
Fast Refresh: Both plugins support Fast Refresh, a feature that allows for retaining the component state and quickly reflecting code changes without a full page reload.
Babel vs. SWC: Babel is a widely-used tool for JavaScript compilation and transformation, while SWC is a newer, high-performance alternative designed for faster builds.
This updated description provides a clear and current overview of the React + Vite setup and the official plugins available for enhancing the development experience.
